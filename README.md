# About project
This app it was conceived super OOP, SOLID, DRY app.
In this case it is overinjenering, but i wanted create this app if it will be expandable.

Now it's not over yet. But when I have free time of my job, i continue finishing this app.
In this app use OOP, SOLID, DRY, Unit testing( google recomendation test class).

Everything is written as abstractly as possible so that it can be tested on test models and the tests do not depend on the implementation (because if there is a change in the model, the test will fall)
